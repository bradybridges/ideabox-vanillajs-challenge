## Description
  An application made by me in less than 5hrs, to showcase my effectiveness in vanilla js. Ideabox was a previous project I did when first learning JavaScript that took me 5 days to complete.
  This iteration of the project was completed much quicker and adheres to SRP principles more strongly, while boasting a cleaner UI.
